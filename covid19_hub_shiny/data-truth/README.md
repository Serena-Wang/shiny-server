# Truth data

This folder contains the truth data that forecasts are compared to. 
The main files in this folder contain the JHU data while subfolders
contain other data sources.
As described in the 
[technical README](../data-processed/README.md),
the JHU data is being used as the "gold standard" for forecasts.
